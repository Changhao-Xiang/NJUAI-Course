- Necessary dependencies: argparse, numpy, torch, scipy, statsmodels
- To reproduce the reported results, you can run the following scripts under `./HW3/` directory, for evaluation of ARIMA and ThetaMethod forecasting models:

    `bash scripts/run_arima.sh`

    `bash scripts/run_theta.sh`

    for evaluation of ResidualModel:

    `bash scripts/run_residual.sh`

- The datasets used in HW3 are `ETTh1`, `ETTh2`, `ETTm1`, `ETTm2`, `Electricity`, `Traffic`, `Weather`, `Exchange`, `ILI`.
